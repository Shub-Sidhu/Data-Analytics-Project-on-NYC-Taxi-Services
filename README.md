# Data-Analytics-Project-on-NYC-Taxi-Services
This project explores the relationship between payment type (cash vs. card) and fare amount in New York City taxi services. Using statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we aim to determine if the method of payment significantly impacts fare prices. 

Objectives
*) Investigate whether fare amounts differ based on payment type.
*) Apply statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to understand fare distributions.
*) Perform hypothesis testing (T-test) to evaluate the statistical significance of observed differences.

Methodology
*) Data Analysis: The project uses Python for data manipulation and visualization.
*) Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Pyplot, and SciPy.

Project Conclusion:
The analysis revealed that fares tend to be higher for card payments. Based on this insight, we recommend that the company consider offering more incentives for card transactions and strengthen security measures to promote safe and convenient card payments.
